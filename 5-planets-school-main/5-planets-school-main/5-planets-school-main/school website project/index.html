        <p class="intro">In this website I will talk about the best 3 planets in my opinion.<br>
            Why even bother with writing about planets? Well first of all we <br>
            live on one obviously, and this planet is dying thanks to humans.<br>
            Moving to a different planet might not be the worst idea so today I will<br>
            review what the best 3 planets are for us to possibly live on in the future!
            (in my opinion)

                        Mars is one of the closest planets to earth, yet it looks like a hostile wasteland that is very unsuitable for Life.<br>
                       In recent years oganizations like Nasa and SpaceX have been studying the red planet very carefully and SpaceX has made <br>
                       it it's mission to make Mars suitable for Life. Better yet it has been discovered that mars used to have huge lakes and <br>
                       oceans, but where have they all gone? Most Water on Mars is all ice now and mars doesn't even have an atmosphere to keep <br>
                       humans safe, but humanity will find a way to make mars suitable, wether it is through teraforming or making huge colonies, <br>
                       mars will 100% be a new home.

                        This is one of the most similar planets to earth, It is 60% bigger than earth,"a super earth" as scientists like to call it.<br>
                        It orbits a star roughly the same size and temoerature as our sun, and it's in the habitable zone. Kepler-452 b has an orbit<br>
                        of 385 days. It is often referred to as Earth 2.0 or Earths older cousin.

                        First of all this planet is already cool because it has the name 'EPIC'. It's star is about half the size of our sun and this planet <br>
                        1.6 times bigger than earth, it's warm and might have suitable conditions for life already. This planet is 127 lightyears away from <br>
                        earth and although that might seem a bit far it's acctually really close compared to most other things in the universe. What's really<br>
                        interesting is that one side is always facing it's star and the other side is in complete darkness. What mysteries could this planet<br>
                        hold?
