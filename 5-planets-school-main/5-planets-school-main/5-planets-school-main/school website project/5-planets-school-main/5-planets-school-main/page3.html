    <h1>Why earth is awesome</h1>
    <p class="intro">
        Although the rest of the universe is great, let's take a look at why earth is great!
    </p>
    

    <div class="things">
        <h2>Rich atmosphere</h2>

        Not only has our atmosphere been through a lot, but even after so much it still continues<br>
        to be an amazing source of life, not only does it provide us with nice fresh air, but it<br>
        also protects us from deadly awful radation from space and all sorts of nasty things out<br>
        there.<br>

    <div class="things">
        <h2>Water</h2>

        <br>
        Water is great! Not only do they provide us with endless fun, swimming and jumping in it, but<br>
        they are also a fundumental element for life on Earth. The water on earth is easy to access as<br>
        it is in liquid form, so it's easy to access and drink. Although there might not be much fresh<br>
        water on the surface, recently scientists have discovered that there is a lot of water under <br>
        earths crust! Maybe even more water than we have on the surface. Better yet, there is also Life<br>
        down there!<br>

    <div class="things">
    <h2>Life</h2>

    <p3 class="para3">
        <br>
        The thing that earth is most famous for is defenitly is it's abundance of life. It took billions <br>
        of years to develop and it's hopefully going to keep developing for billions of years, but life is<br>
        of the most magical things on earth, from Amoebas to humans, earth is riddled with complex lifeforms<br>
        and it is humans mission to protect all life on earth.
